<h1>Dangerous food additives to avoid eating</h1>
<div class="art-divs">
<p>Because my health and health of my family matters, throughout years 
I’ve looked into several publications and research that have been done 
regarding food additives, preservatives, artificial sweeteners and 
colors, and put together table that can be a simple guide to those who 
prefer to be cautious and who like to have a choice, to decide what to 
consume. Some of us might be more sensitive to chemicals than others.</p>
<p>To share my personal findings, here is a new printable list with 
identifying code numbers of the nasty food additives that we avoid 
eating. Artificial food preservatives, food colors and flavor enhancers,
 many of these can be dangerous chemicals added to our food and are 
known to be linked to Hyperactivity, Attention-Deficit Disorder (ADD), 
Asthma, Cancer, Poisonings and other negative medical conditions.</p>
<h1>Where to look for food additives on a product label?</h1>
<p>When buying groceries, these additives are listed (if it’s given by the law) on the food product’s packaging under <strong>“INGREDIENTS:</strong>” or “<strong>CONTAINS:</strong>”
 section, usually next to “Nutrition Information” but the code numbers 
or names of these additives can be printed on in a small font. <span id="more-122"></span></p>
<p class="p_box">In my opinion placement of the text can be sometimes 
somewhat hidden or perhaps even misleading. Which isn’t right. Any 
dangerous additives added in the food, if the product contains any, 
really should be listed visibly (those people who experience health 
issues and unpleasant reactions prefer having them labeled on their food
 packs for instance as “<strong>Nasty Additives</strong>“.</p>
<h2>330 and E330 Citric Acid</h2>
<p>How about the Citric Acid E330 or 330? No problem with naturally 
occurring citric acid. Artificially produced E330 or 330 additive, 
depending on where or how it is produced with using sulfuric acid, many 
believe the product might still contain mold and sulfur/sulfites not 
filtered out completely during the production (Sulfur dioxide and other 
sulfites (also referred to as sulphites, [do not confuse with sulfate]) 
are among food additives in the list below, under H – A, causing 
asthmatic and allergic reactions.) For most people sulfites are safe, 
but for example sensitive aspirin allergies or asthma sufferers can 
react very severely to sulfites.</p>
<p>In the year 1953 Sir Hans Krebs received Nobel Prize for physiology medicine for discovering that the <strong>Citric acid</strong>
 in metabolic reactions acts as part in series of compounds occurring 
within physiological oxidation of proteins, carbohydrates and fats and 
turning them into water and Carbon dioxide. Called Tricarboxylic Acid 
Cycle or known as the Krebs Cycle which is involved in most metabolic 
reactions, where the Citric acid plays a major role. <br> * The world 
“krebs” translates to English word “cancer” … and that’s what created 
the misunderstanding that citric acid 330 – e330 causes cancer. But in 
fact it does not. It is an organic acid used as additive in foods, in 
drinks, in beer, wine or cheese production, citric acid prevents 
bacteria growth, it gives the citric/sour flavor, bakers use it, citric 
acid E330 or 330 is often added to cakes, biscuits, soups, all sorts of 
sauces, frozen packed and canned food products, sweets, marmalade’s, ice
 creams, which is positive and tasty … you can find it mentioned on the 
packaging.</p>

<h2>Food additives to avoid …</h2>
<p>… linked to hyperactivity, asthma, cancer – avoid these in your own will in your every day diet! <br>
 If allergic and other reactions to food additives can occur hours and 
even days later after they are consumed therefore it can be hard for 
many people to notice any connection links. A noticeable contrast, as to
 spot a positive change resulting from food intake, if necessary, could 
possibly be achieved by starting to eat and cook for a period of time 
only natural raw, not modified, food items. Thus comparing the effects 
against the previous diet and potentially seeing or feeling some 
difference.</p>
<h2><a name="pp">MSG — Monosodium Glutamate</a></h2>
<p class="p_box">H, A, -, are the ONLY known information on glutamate. 
In connection with cancer tumors research that came to my attention is 
in this <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15927426?dopt=Abstract" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">page on PubMed</a>.
 Is it enough to label MSG with C or is it not? I do not know, research 
always helps. For instance a great work by Dr. Russell Blaylock 
neurosurgeon, his book on toxic effect of MSG on human brain 
“Excitotoxins: The Taste That Kills” was published already in the year 
1994 (Updated edition in 1996.) He is author of other very interesting 
books not only on MSG or aspartame. Find out about his Wellness Center 
at RussellBlaylockMD.com website.</p>

<p>matthews, agreed 330 is all right. it’s been added on the page now . i
 guess it wasn’t included in this table as it contains only food

<p>I read an article, written by the noble anti-cancer crusaders Cancer 
Research, that essentially stated that aspartame was safe to consume, 
Aspartame 951 artificial sweetener. I was really shocked. It just seems 
that mainstream groups, as they become more mainstream appear to become 
more compromised. In today’s climate it’s almost as if being concerned 
about the dangers of the manipulation of food, such as adding sweeteners
 or GM foods etc. makes one a fanatic that shouldn’t be taken seriously.<br>
When reputable organisations come out on the side of the food industry 
who are clearly unconcerned about the health of the people who consume 
their products, it really does make one realise that this is a very 
serious. Many appear to be bent on stopping at nothing in order to 
increase their profits. Where will all this end? I am worried.<br>
It is sad to observe that those whose stated objective is to rid us of 
this awful disease could possibly ignore research that concludes that 
certain ‘foods’ can cause cancer, &amp; on top of that write an article 
that condones the use of such possibly dangerous substances. One would 
expect them to err on the side of caution at the very least &amp; to 
urge the public to do the same. Is that really too much to expect?<br>
 Good luck to those of you who are willing to state the facts &amp; help us to make informed decisions regarding our diet.</p>

<p>Thanks for an interesting website.  I’ve been doing a lot of research
 on the internet trying to decipher all the ‘numbers’ and yours is most 
informative.  The chemical companies risk losing millions (if not 
billions) of dollars if anyone really proves how dangerous these food 
‘numbers’ are.  Hence there is a lot of misdirection and false 
information mainly influenced by these clongomerates protecting their $.
 That’s why they don’t use the same name for the chemical additive or 
number all over the world to make our life more difficult in trying to 
work out what we should and should not eat.</p>

<p>Thanks so much for the informative list dangerous food additives. We 
really have to keep on top of these for our children’s sake. I can see 
the reaction within one hour if my daughter (4) consumes some of these

personality. I am now also seeing evidence in my younger son’s (1)

<p>Hello again!  You were the first port of call for my research on 
preservatives and I thank you for the information.  You also helped me 
out a while back with your very helpful advice on <a href="https://www.traditionaloven.com/tutorials/health/cold_sore_virus_prevention.html" title="Healing coldsores and prevention of herpes virus." rel="nofollow">prevention and healing of cold sores</a>.
  I tried the lemon balm – good results.  My recent attack didn’t 
develop beyond the first tingles and first symptoms.  Diet – avoidance 
of certain foods and boosting my immune has certainly helped.  Many

artificial ingredient in a food, or color for each chemical additive? I 
believe the whole word needs to go to all natural foods only like 
organic or bio dynamic and raw foods.</p>

<p>The information above is good. However, citric acid is a weak ORGANIC
 acid. You can vertually find it in any sour fruits and vegetables, like
 lemons and even sour apples. It is not artificially made. So you cannot
 say that citric acid is a food additive. This is a good topic, but a 
weak argument. :)</p>
<p><strong>added by admin</strong>: Dear Sarah,<br>
Thank you for your note. Yes I agree with you fully/completely. But, 
have you seen the 2 paragraphs above in this article, right at the 
beginning on the page. This is related to basically badly produced, only
 the artificially made, citric acid; starting with 4th paragraph … “How 
about the Citric Acid E330 or 330? No problem with naturally occurring 
citric acid. Artificially produced E330 or 330 additive, depending on 
where or …” please find it. It is not mentioned in the table among only 
harmful additives, however it’s explained in the text. Some people might
 get into nasty troubles after taking citric acid in such dirty form. 
Actually there is one comment here about it also. Please let me know 
when you see it.</p>

<p>Thanks for this great list. But I’m wondering about carageenan. When I
 lived on the coast of Ireland, we used carageenan moss that was a kind 
of seaweed to make pudding, etc. Is this not the same as the carageenan 
that’s used commercially? If so, what’s the difference?</p>
<p><cite>By Carageenan — <small><a href="#comment-9125">Permalink</a></small></cite></p>

<li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="comment-9126">
<p>I think certainly the wholesome carrageenan moss that you used to use
 to make puddings (I must say to me the pudding sounds very tasty) could
 have been all right and very healthy to eat. Especially if the 
carrageen was in the form as is when taken out from a sea water. Many 
food additives are not dangerous. It comes to what is used and how 
commercially made additives are extracted and prepared. Other chemicals 
might be used to manufacture food additives. Also the well known MSG is 
taken out from rice (prior to that altering the rice was natural.) Or 
you would have certainly heard of aspartame (artificial sugar substitute
 and non saccharide or non saccharin sweetener) which is also derived 
from natural plants, natural decayed plants that is, which were stored 
by nature under the ground for so long they turned to oil. You can see 
not all natural sources are healthy. However in relation to the 
carrageenan – 407 and E407 Carrageenan ( thickening and stabilizing 
agent ) – asthma and cancer – I am not sure whether I can post web links
 in here, but simply search on the web for “Cancer research, Filament 
dis-assembly and loss of mammary myoepithelial cells after exposure to 
carrageenan, by Joanne Tobacman”, and “Cancer detection and prevention, 
Carrageenan-induced inclusions in mammary mycoepithelial cells”, and 
then “Consumption of carrageenan and other water-soluble polymers used 
as food additives and incidence of mammary carcinoma, medical 
hypothesis, by J. K. Tobacman, R. B. Wallace, M. B. Zimmerman”. There 
are other related studies on the same subjects, for instance; exposing 
human breast tissue cells, intestinal cells and prostate cells to 
carageen additive for short intervals in low concentrations, may be 
relevant to the occurrence of an invasive malignancy.</p>

E330 (I know in fizzy drinks) it sent them totally hypo with no doubts –

Hi Sally, thank you for your note! If something is not 100% safe I don’t
 want to go near it. What we put into our organism as food is one of the
 first things we should watch.</p>
<p>I looked up the E171 additive, it is already completely banned in 
Germany. PubMed.gov mentions, there is a whole paragraph about E171 food
 additive ( Titanium Dioxide, TiO<sub>2</sub> ), the language is quite 
technical, but so far they say that E171 can even alter DNA. An 
oxidative lesions were measured (changes?). The article is very current.
 I wonder, is this the nano Technology, nanoparticles of titanium 
dioxide go into foods? Nano-particle sized matter may penetrate body 
tissue.</p>
<p>I also read that from exposure to titanium dioxide – TiO<sub>2</sub> –
 nano particles, a person experienced in lungs a type of pneumonia, 
interstitial lung condition/disease Bronchiolitis Obliterans (BO) with 
Organizing Pneumonia (BOOP) (I do not know how it was delivered to his 
or her body). After consumption it can be found in human lymphatic 
system as it is hard for our organism to break it down. We can think 
about it also this way; lymphatic system is slow, then this e171 
basically travels around slowly through our body because human body does
 not know what to do with it.</p>
<p>Well, it is used as pigment to give certain foods opacity, white 
opaque color. Otherwise it’s also mixed into other products, where it 
also could be referred to as Titania or titanium IV oxide. E.g. it’s 
been used as UV absorber in sunscreens, plastics, paints and coatings, 
paper, or some toothpastes. I will look at the other 2 E’s.</p>

363, 478, 904, 1442 as ones for my son to avoid as well and I could not 
find what foods they are in which makes it hard. The sad and disgusting 
part of all this is that our government allows these poisons into our 
foods which is pathetic. Ban all these and I would imagine all of our 
health would improve and why should we have to do the governments work 
in looking at every packet of food to make sure we are not being 
silently poisoned. Yes these additives may preserve the food and in fact
 studies have shown that if someone has died and if you checked their 
body in ten years time it would not have broken down because of the 
amount of preservatives so yes not only  do they preserve the food we 
eat but preserves our bodies when we are gone but silently kills us in 
the process. What a lovely world we live in. Thanks again.</p>

<p>Just to let you know, Benzoic acid which you list as a carcinogen is 
used to prevent spoilage by many families in rural India. I was told 
this by an Indian colleague (with a PhD in chemistry). He was from the 
Dargeeling area of India and he said that there was no refrigeration in 
his home and they added benzoic acid to their food to prevent spoilage. 
He told me this was common practice where he lived as a child.</p>
<p><strong>added by admin</strong>:<br>
Hello thank you; Please search for ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), or with 
other acidic solutions e.g. vinegar, in combination with 211 &amp; E211 
sodium benzoate (210 &amp; E210 Benzoic acid is a close relative – more 
below.) When these react they may create a small amount of chemical 
which causes some cancers, one of them is leukemia. Although apparently 
the risk of cancer is very small, why would consumers have to experience
 these risks, there is no need for that.</p>
<p>Various producers had to stop using sodium benzoate as food 
preservative e.g. in soft drinks, carbonated drinks, fruit juices or 
pickles, etc. Some producers did use the benzoic acid / sodium benzoate 
for ages for preventing microorganism-s growth in acidic kind of foods. 
The naturally occurring clean Benzoic acid substance (in plants or in 
animals) look to be quite fine although they might still cause asthma, 
hives, and alike allergic reactions in individuals who are sensitive to 
these substances. But then there are the artificially produced (cheaper)
 substitutions for natural substances.</p>

<p>Good to see such great information here helping people. However there
 is more information on what is good for your health and what is 
definitely NOT good. There is a list of ‘clean’ and unclean’ foods in 
Chapter 11 of the Book of Leviticus in the Bible. Just putting this up 
there for those who truly want to add even more great health to their 
lives. For instance Cochineal comes from the insect which God considers 
unclean, so do not eat it. Pork and prawns are big No-no’s, for a good 
reason. Prawns and shellfish trawl the bottom of the oceans cleaning up 
the waste products from the ocean life. Our bodies do not process this 
waste well. So much more I could say but if anyone here is serious about
 their health check out this chapter. Blessings to all and process foods

everything we touch, eat and drink. I would like to pick you brain on a 
few things as relates to that. You obviously know a lot about it. I am

Hi Mike,<br>
There is loads of excellent literature on these topics available. And 
also DVD movies I believe. All produced by the right people. Chemicals 
or too much improper sweeteners and alike in foods aren’t helping us at 
all. I am also sensitive to several additives some of which give me 
nasty attacks. And as you mention not only to the wrong chemicals added 
into foods. Took a long time to come to a realization, often it can be 
tricky to notice where the problems lie, most often these connections 
might show or react not so obvious. Perceiving such a thing, that a 
person could be sick and getting more ill from what he or she eats, is 
rather weird.</p>
<p>Took me a long time to get used -to cook meals from, or consume, 
mainly raw foods. We have been eating 100% only organic now. It doesn’t 
cost more, it costs less on wallet to eat organic only. Because of the 
amount of proper nutrients we eat a lot smaller quantity (not just 
marginally). Juicing for instant is marvelous, in so many health and 
healing aspects. Plus, apart the possibility of treating various health 
issues, one glass of organic juice keeps me going half a day. Vegetables
 in, rarely sweet fruits (max half green apple in each glass.) There are
 good books and DVD movies on this as well. My partner is engaged in 
this as nutritionist.</p>
<p>You probably mean also the chemicals found in other products and items we come in contact with in life, not just food.</p>

<p>I have been eating healthily for a year, growing my own organic food,
 and eating mostly whole foods only, with a lot of raw. Yesterday I had a
 weak moment and bought a bag of ‘Mr Mallow’ marsh mallows. If I had 
bothered to read the label at the supermarket I would not have bought 
them. They contain corn syrup which I have never, to my knowledge 
consumed before, colour (129), and flavours (with no number). How can 
they just say ‘flavours’ with no number? Also, they are imported from 
overseas. I am suffering now with my first migraine in 2 years, and it 
is all my fault. NEVER AGAIN. Whole, organic and natural is good. If it 
comes in a bag it is POISON.</p>
<p><strong>added by Rado</strong>:<br>
I hope your pain stopped! Try not to eat cheese and chocolate as well, 
these contain a chemical (not on top of my mind right now) which 
initiates migraine episodes. Organic, raw and whole foods, I am on such 
for ~ 2 months now. It’s more interesting. No caffeine either. The first
 2 weeks I didn’t know what to put into my mouth. But now, all those gr8
 goodies like coconut yogurt, fresh organic certified vegetable/fruit 
juices I prepare, various sprouts breads and so on; I feel so much 
better, sleep better, lost weight, cannot complain at all. It’s actually
 more affordable with this organic nutrients due to the fact that I eat 
smaller quantities and even-then it’s plenty in the nutritional energy 
sense. No meat but I take Folate B12’s supplement one per day. * I also 
made an error the other day, got myself a nice soy yogurt 200g, and only
 after I finished it all I noticed high sugar added (13.5g out of 100g /
 13.5% / probably cheap white sugar kind) – my system immediately 
protested which made me to read the ingredients list – the yogurt came 
from a health store where I shop!</p>
<p>If they just mention a ‘flacour/s’ on a packaging I don’t eat such 
product as it can be just about anything. Manufacturers aren’t required 
to disclose flavours if they are the product’s marketing secret-recipe, 
as a protection for no one copies it easily.</p>

<p>We shouldn’t eat food that has been dead/picked/harvested for that 
long? With artificial food additives? So what do we watch for when it 
comes to bad food additives? This E numbers’ list is ENDLESS, and you 
can’t possibly memorize this whole thing, so I will print it out and for
 now pick/focus on the wrong food&nbsp;coloring.</p>

<p>MSG is not actually toxic; though that is common belief it is 
actually a myth that has been repeatedly disproven. Although it is not 
toxic some people could be allergic to it. </p>
<p>Please do your research. I would have thought your little food

<p>Hi SneezyBear,<br>
Thank you very much for your comment. “<i>Together we will travel much further.</i>”</p>
<p>I made note of all the points and considered them all. I thoroughly 
red that page/info on wikipedia you perhaps sourced your knowledge from.
 Are we contemplating naturally occurring glutamic acid in nature here 
(e.g. mothers and animal milk, meats, other protein products), or the 
manufactured glutamic acid (MSG)?</p>
<p>Given that wikipedia is probably not also yours first and last stop 
for all learning nor the only source of information, because of its 
humongous size to keep updated constantly, the confusion is quite 
understandable. However, your valuable feedback leads me to hope that my
 comment is helpful rather than annoying.</p>
<p>Please have a look into the content on the page linked below. A bit 
is mentioned on the page regarding to manufactured MSG and then further 
referrals. Worth to be informed about, perhaps if still needed. I also 
have other source on MSG (produced) to consider I could share with 
others. It’s not a secret. But, as always, same as with many other 
aspects we come into contact with in this fast live we live in; some 
things might never harm one individual in any way but such can be right 
the opposite for another person unfortunately.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.msgtruth.org/cancer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">msgtruth.org</a><br>
Note the link to PubMed (gov) under braking news in the article <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15927426?dopt=Abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ncbi.nlm.nih.gov pubmed</a> , and next there is additional reading on asthma plus ADD, ADHD and so on in the right hand side manu, plus the home page.</p>
<p>I agree we should be always opened to fresher updated news 
discoveries and suggestions. PLEASE let us know of anything new or 
interesting you may come across with. The published findings are 
gradually becoming less conflicting so is it worth the risks? I wish 
these findings open doors not only to the irresistible taste MSG 
additive gives to processed foods but also to a possibility of health 
harm. Regulations of many governments already require to list MSG 
content on all food product packaging’s. isn’t it a neurotoxin as well!</p>
<p>We are not biologically programmed to resist what is put out there for us to process, neither certain foods nor opinions.</p>

<p>To those of you who are thinking of taking this list to the grocery 
stores, I don’t think you’ll find many processed foodstuffs that don’t 
have more than one of these additives to avoid in the label. My 
understanding is to eat foods that don’t come with a label or in a box 
with a shelf-life, don’t eat the Dirty 10 unless it’s either certified 
organic, or organic from a known source, and most canned foods are 
suspects so read the label. There’s much more, I just can’t say it all!!<br>

many people. Incidentally, I was brought to attention to this code 
recently, E955 also known as sacralose. It was stated as a form of 
addificial sweetener, can anyone shared with me if this chemical 
substance will consider a danger to our body? A friend introduced a new 
product to me, a 100% cane sugar extract, only ingredient called E995.

ADHD. </p>
<p>Looking at what has been printed here on this website, gave me am 
insight into what triggers him off. So any foods with the numbers listed
 above have been thrown out of my cupboard. I now look and read each 
label. It may take me longer to do my shopping, but I know now that he 
is eating the right foods.</p>
<p>Helps as well in choosing healthy options for him. I want to thank
